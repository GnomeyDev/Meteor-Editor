# Meteor-Editor
A text editor using Electron and JavaScript

## How to use
### Beta / Manual
The Beta / Manual version of Meteor is the current version that I am developing
actively. This may not work or may have bugs and other problematic things.

#### Windows
To get a copy of the repo open your command prompt and enter the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/GnomeyDev/Meteor-Editor

cd Meteor-editor

npm start
```

This should create / open the version of Meteor that you installed.
If this doesn't work (can happen for multiple reasons) please report it here:
https://github.com/GnomeyDev/Meteor-Editor/issues/new
or join the Discord using the link below:

Things that make errors:
- Not being in the right directory
- Typos of any kind
